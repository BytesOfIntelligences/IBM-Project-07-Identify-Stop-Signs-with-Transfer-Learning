# IBM-Project-07-Identify-Stop-Signs-with-Transfer-Learning
As part of the machine learning team for a corporation developing self-driving cars, you are working on a new stop sign detection technology. In order to determine if there is a stop sign when the car is on the road, your team proposes to capture snapshots every second, signaling the car to stop when there's a stop sign detected in the image.
